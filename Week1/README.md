## üéØ Overview

This repository contains my **Week 1 Python Automation** projects. The goal of this week was to **strengthen Python fundamentals** and build **small automation scripts**.  
The projects cover:

- Data types, variables, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Functions, scope, and lambda expressions  
- Modules, packages, and pip basics  
- File I/O and CSV handling  
- Exception handling and CLI tools  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Mini project: automation script for file renaming

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

‚úÖ **All code is written by me** with full understanding.  
‚úÖ In some cases, I **used AI (ChatGPT) to write comments or refactor code**, but the **code itself is not directly written by AI**. I understood the logic and made fixes myself.  
‚úÖ Most of the **README.md files were generated with AI assistance**. If there are any mistakes, I apologize in advance.

## üìÇ Scripts & Topics

| Day | Script | Topic | Description |
|-----|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `day1_datatypes.py` | Data types & variables | Takes user input, stores in lists/dicts, prints summary statistics (sum, max, min, avg). |
| 2 | `day2_functions.py` | Functions & scope | Functions for sum, average, min, max on a list of numbers; demonstrates global/local variables. |
| 3 | `day3_modules.py` | Modules & pip basics | Uses `os` and `random` to list files and pick random files; demonstrates module usage. |
| 4 | `day4_fileio.py` | File I/O & CSV | Reads a CSV of scores, calculates stats, writes results to new CSV, handles exceptions. |
| 5 | `day5_cli_tool.py` | Exception handling & CLI | Accepts input file via CLI, calculates sum/avg, raises assertion for invalid/empty data. |
| 6 | `day6_oop.py` | Small OOP | Defines `Student` class; calculates total/average marks, prints student details. |
| 7 | `day7_file_automation.py` | Mini project | Renames files in a folder with date prefix, logs renamed files, handles exceptions, optional CLI folder path. |
